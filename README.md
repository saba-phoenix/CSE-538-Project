# CSE-538-Project
Predicting the likelihood of a book

There are 5 files.

1. Run Liblinear to reproduce the result in the paper 1.

2. Run Doc2Vec  to reproduce the result in the paper 2.

3. Run w2v to generate the word embedding of the every book.

4. Find common word between a book and the global embedding sapce and save the common word vectors.

5. Association analysis will generate calcualte the associatio and bias the predict the likelihood.

6. For the alignment I used vecmap, there 10 bat files in folder. These bat file generate the aligned embedding space.
